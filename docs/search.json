First, the data is over 56 year period (1960 to 2016), where the number of population in most of the country increasing and health condition improving. To get better understanding about this figure, we need to include other variables such as GDP, fertility and other variables.\n\n\nMore data processing\nIn this step, I am going to find out which year\n\nmissing_years &lt;- africadata %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(infant_mortality)) %&gt;% # Filter rows where infant_mortality is NA\n  select(year) %&gt;%                    # Select the 'year' column\n  distinct()                          # Get unique years\n\n# Display missing years\nprint(missing_years)\n\n   year\n1  1960\n2  1961\n3  1962\n4  1963\n5  1964\n6  1965\n7  1966\n8  1967\n9  1968\n10 1969\n11 1970\n12 1971\n13 1972\n14 1973\n15 1974\n16 1975\n17 1976\n18 1977\n19 1978\n20 1979\n21 1980\n22 1981\n23 2016\n\n\nThere are 23 years with missing data in infant mortality\nNow, I want to create a new object containing data of the year 2000 only.\n\ndata_2000 &lt;- africadata %&gt;%\n  filter(year==2000)\n\n\nstr(data_2000)\n\n'data.frame':   51 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  33.9 128.3 89.3 52.4 96.2 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  73.3 52.3 57.2 47.6 52.6 46.7 54.3 68.4 45.3 51.5 ...\n $ fertility       : num  2.51 6.84 5.98 3.41 6.59 7.06 5.62 3.7 5.45 7.35 ...\n $ population      : num  31183658 15058638 6949366 1736579 11607944 ...\n $ gdp             : num  5.48e+10 9.13e+09 2.25e+09 5.63e+09 2.61e+09 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n\nsummary(data_2000)\n\n         country        year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     : 1   Min.   :2000   Min.   : 12.30   Min.   :37.60  \n Angola      : 1   1st Qu.:2000   1st Qu.: 60.80   1st Qu.:51.75  \n Benin       : 1   Median :2000   Median : 80.30   Median :54.30  \n Botswana    : 1   Mean   :2000   Mean   : 78.93   Mean   :56.36  \n Burkina Faso: 1   3rd Qu.:2000   3rd Qu.:103.30   3rd Qu.:60.00  \n Burundi     : 1   Max.   :2000   Max.   :143.30   Max.   :75.00  \n (Other)     :45                                                  \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent \n Min.   :1.990   Min.   :    81154   Min.   :2.019e+08   Africa  :51  \n 1st Qu.:4.150   1st Qu.:  2304687   1st Qu.:1.274e+09   Americas: 0  \n Median :5.550   Median :  8799165   Median :3.238e+09   Asia    : 0  \n Mean   :5.156   Mean   : 15659800   Mean   :1.155e+10   Europe  : 0  \n 3rd Qu.:5.960   3rd Qu.: 17391242   3rd Qu.:8.654e+09   Oceania : 0  \n Max.   :7.730   Max.   :122876723   Max.   :1.329e+11                \n                                                                      \n                       region  \n Eastern Africa           :16  \n Western Africa           :16  \n Middle Africa            : 8  \n Northern Africa          : 6  \n Southern Africa          : 5  \n Australia and New Zealand: 0  \n (Other)                  : 0  \n\n\nthere are 51 country selected in 2000 without missing data for child mortatlity\n\nplot3 &lt;- ggplot(data = data_2000, aes(x = infant_mortality, y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + # Map 'region' to the color aesthetic\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) + # Add a smoothing line\n  labs(\n    subtitle = \"(Figure 3.

In these figures, I use different color based on the region, it can help visualize some figures. For example, we can see that overall, Northern Africa region generally had higher life expectancy compared to other regions, while eastern region had lower life expectancy.\n\n\nFitting simple models\nIn this part, I want to perform simple linear model to look at the relationship between infant mortality and life expectancy, and country population on life expectancy.\n\nfit1 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = data_2000)\nsummary(fit1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = data_2000)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-22.6651  -3.7087   0.9914   4.0408   8.6817 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

It is estimated that every 1000 increase child mortality results in decrease life expectancy by 0.2 year Based on the alpha=0.05, it can be concluded that there is a statistically significant relationship between infant mortality rate and life expectancy with p&lt;.0001.\n\nfit2 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ population, data = data_2000)\nsummary(fit2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ population, data = data_2000)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-18.429  -4.602  -2.568   3.800  18.802 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Based on the intercept, it is estimated that when country population is zero, the average life expectancy is 5.6 years, but in the reality, it does not make sense since none of country has 0 population. Based on the alpha= 5% there is no significant relationship between country population and life expectancy with p=0.616."

    "text": "My Name is Muhammad Nasir, Call me “NASIR”, it’s originally from Arabic Language “Naseer” meaning “The Helper”. I love that name. However, many people hard to pronounce it, so many people here (or when I was in the UK) call me Muhammad, which I is fine for me. I am from Indonesia. I am a little boy from small village Called “Kindang”, a remote area in the foot of Bawakaraeng Mountain in South Sulawesi Indonesia. However, I left the village since I was 12 YO, moving to a city where I did my middle school, and keep moving from one city to other cities for each level of my education. I am the luckiest guy in the village (or in the world) because I can skip the chain of poverty and the darkness of lack of education for myself (and my family now), I am the first generation going to school in entire my big Family. So I am so PROUD to be here and lived in several different countries (Education is the gate of the world, and education changes life).\nI love “NATURE”, specially hidden gem. and I am lucky to be born and grown up in Indonesia, where billions of hidden gem that we can visit. One of the hidden “HEAVEN” that I can show you in the picture below, called ” PAISU POK LAKE” in Central Sulawesi, it takes eight hours by boat to enjoy this beautiful view. You can see “ancient trees buried in the lake”.\n\n\nPictures: PAISU POK Lake in Banggai Kepulauan Island in Indonesia.\nFun facts: After I got 12 YO, I never live in a city more than 4 years.\nHobby: Playing badminton, Hiking and Hide myself and sleep in hidden gems for days.\n\nEducational Background\nI obtained my Bachelor of Public health with Environmental Health Concentration from Universitas Muslim Indonesia in Makassar. I did my Master degree at The University of Birmingham, UK on Public and Environmental Science. This course was prepared for being a practitioner in environmental health. I did pre doctoral program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign before starting my PhD at the University of Georgia.\n\n\nWorking Experience\nI worked in several different topics/ fields. Before I started my master, I worked as an intern at Ministry of Environment Republic Indonesia on a project called ” Culture and biodiversity in Raja Ampat ” (I highly recommend you to GOOGLE “RAJA AMPAT INDONESIA”, you would see a heaven that you must put in your travel lists). After my Master, I worked on a Project “WASH Post Disaster in Central Sulawesi” funded by WHO. Then in 2019, I worked with Universitas Indonesia and UNICEF on Adolescence Mental Health Post Disaster in Central Sulawesi. In 2020, I worked at Kerti Praja Foundation on a project called ” Implementation of Integrated Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) Service in Primary Care in four different provinces in Indonesia, funded by UNFPA Indonesia and Government of Japan. Right before I came to the USA, I work at WHO Indonesia as a national consultant for Malaria Elimination in Central Sulawesi (only three months and have to resign to pursue higher degree). Although I worked in many different topics, the nature of the jobs that I did was similar, most of the things that I did was about community empowerment, program development, and policy advocacy to local governments. None of my previous work related to Epidemiology or Biostatistics, but I am so lucky to be in this department at the moment.\n\nPicture: Delivering a training for community leader about GBV survivor outreach in community level (my little guard, SEAN, who always accompanies me at work. Luckily, most work places in my place are child friendly).\n\n\nData analysis experience\nHonestly, I am very new in quantitative data analysis, let say I started it at UGA. Most of my work deal with qualitative data or for quantitative data, they are prepared by data analysts. Therefore, my data analysis experience only relate to class assignment or projects. I started Using R last year, so please help me grow and I am happy if people can involve me in their project for data analysis (for Free :) ), I just need to learn and get more experience.\n\n\nResearch Interest\nI am currently interested in Climate Change and its implication to public health. I am also interested in communicable diseases such as Tuberculosis, Soil-transmitted Helminths, water born diseases, and vector born diseases."

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along."
